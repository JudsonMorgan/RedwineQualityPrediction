### RedwineQualityPrediction

Predicting the quality of red wine using some independent features.
In this project, some tasks such as Outlier Detection/Anomaly removal, Features selection, Feature scaling, and Hyperparameter tuning has been carried out to ensure our model learns properly and performs as expected on unseen data.

## To Do
1. clone repo
2. Download the dataset from the link https://www.kaggle.com/code/prasadshingare/red-wine-quality-check/data and store it in a folder 'Downloads' or same folder as the ipynb file.
3. Run each cells.
4. Accuracy of the model can be further improve for future research.
